# Arduino-and-Nokia-LCD4884-display
Simple illustration of using a LCD4884 display shield as a clock. The joystick is used to set the time.

Most postings for this shield (and the Nokia 4884 display) on the internet are several years old. One supplier no longer stocks this item and a note on their website sugests it is no longer compatible with the latest Arduino IDE. I eventually found what may be
an updated library that works with Arduino 1.65 and I have included that library here (with thanks to Yourduino for this library).
